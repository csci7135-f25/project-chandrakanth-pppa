# Certifying Differential Invariants of Neural Networks using Abstract Duals

This repository contains the course project for CSCI 7135 - Principles and Practice of Programming Analysis. The project focuses on proving robustness of neural networks using differential invariants and abstract duals. The implementation is based on the `ocaml-nn` framework.
